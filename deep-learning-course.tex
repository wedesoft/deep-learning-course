\subsection{Introduction}
Machine learning has different applications
\begin{itemize}
\item real estate, online advertising (standard neural networks)
\item image classification (CNN)
\item audio to text, language translation (RNN)
\item position of other cars in autonomous driving (hybrid)
\end{itemize}

Supervised learning uses data consisting of input (x) and desired output (y).
In supervised learning there is structured data (house price and features)
and unstructured data (images, audio, text).

Traditional approaches hit a performance plateau as more and more data becomes available.
Deep learning is facilitated by
\begin{itemize}
\item larger datasets
\item more computational power
\item algorithmic improvements
\end{itemize}

Geoffrey Hinton's advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item read enough so that you start developing intuitions
\item trust your intuitions
\item never stop programming
\end{itemize}
